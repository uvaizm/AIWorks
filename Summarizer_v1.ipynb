            "its official us president barack obama wants lawmakers to weigh in on whether to use military force in syria obama sent a letter to the heads of the house and senate on saturday night hours after announcing that he believes military action against syrian targets is the right step to take over the alleged use of chemical weapons the proposed legislation from obama asks congress to approve the use of military force to deter disrupt prevent and degrade the potential for future uses of chemical weapons or other weapons of mass destruction its a step that is set to turn an international crisis into a fierce domestic political battle there are key questions looming over the debate what did un weapons inspectors find in syria what happens if congress votes no and how will the syrian government react in a televised address from the white house rose garden earlier saturday the president said he would take his case to congress not because he has to but because he wants to while i believe i have the authority to carry out this military action without specific congressional authorization i know that the country will be stronger if we take this course and our actions will be even more effective he said we should have this debate because the issues are too big for business as usual obama said top congressional leaders had agreed to schedule a debate when the body returns to washington on september the senate foreign relations committee will hold a hearing over the matter on tuesday sen robert menendez said transcript read obamas full remarks syrian crisis latest developments un inspectors leave syria obamas remarks came shortly after un inspectors left syria carrying evidence that will determine whether chemical weapons were used in an attack early last week in a damascus suburb the aim of the game here the mandate is very clear and that is to ascertain whether chemical weapons were used and not by whom un spokesman martin nesirky told reporters on saturday but who used the weapons in the reported toxic gas attack in a damascus suburb on august has been a key point of global debate over the syrian crisis top us officials have said theres no doubt that the syrian government was behind it while syrian officials have denied responsibility and blamed jihadists fighting with the rebels british and us intelligence reports say the attack involved chemical weapons but un officials have stressed the importance of waiting for an official report from inspectors the inspectors will share their findings with un secretarygeneral ban kimoon ban who has said he wants to wait until the un teams final report is completed before presenting it to the un security council the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons which nine of the inspectors belong to said saturday that it could take up to three weeks to analyze the evidence they collected it needs time to be able to analyze the information and the samples nesirky said he noted that ban has repeatedly said there is no alternative to a political solution to the crisis in syria and that a military solution is not an option bergen syria is a problem from hell for the us obama this menace must be confronted obamas senior advisers have debated the next steps to take and the presidents comments saturday came amid mounting political pressure over the situation in syria some us lawmakers have called for immediate action while others warn of stepping into what could become a quagmire some global leaders have expressed support but the british parliaments vote against military action earlier this week was a blow to obamas hopes of getting strong backing from key nato allies on saturday obama proposed what he said would be a limited military action against syrian president bashar alassad any military attack would not be openended or include us ground forces he said syrias alleged use of chemical weapons earlier this month is an assault on human dignity the president said a failure to respond with force obama argued could lead to escalating use of chemical weapons or their proliferation to terrorist groups who would do our people harm in a world with many dangers this menace must be confronted syria missile strike what would happen next map us and allied assets around syria obama decision came friday night on friday night the president made a lastminute decision to consult lawmakers what will happen if they vote no its unclear a senior administration official told cnn that obama has the authority to act without congress even if congress rejects his request for authorization to use force obama on saturday continued to shore up support for a strike on the alassad government he spoke by phone with french president francois hollande before his rose garden speech the two leaders agreed that the international community must deliver a resolute message to the assad regime and others who would consider using chemical weapons that these crimes are unacceptable and those who violate this international norm will be held accountable by the world the white house said meanwhile as uncertainty loomed over how congress would weigh in us military officials said they remained at the ready key assertions us intelligence report on syria syria who wants what after chemical weapons horror reactions mixed to obamas speech a spokesman for the syrian national coalition said that the opposition group was disappointed by obamas announcement our fear now is that the lack of action could embolden the regime and they repeat his attacks in a more serious way said spokesman louay safi so we are quite concerned some members of congress applauded obamas decision house speaker john boehner majority leader eric cantor majority whip kevin mccarthy and conference chair cathy mcmorris rodgers issued a statement saturday praising the president under the constitution the responsibility to declare war lies with congress the republican lawmakers said we are glad the president is seeking authorization for any military action in syria in response to serious substantive questions being raised more than legislators including of obamas fellow democrats had signed letters calling for either a vote or at least a full debate before any us action british prime minister david cameron whose own attempt to get lawmakers in his country to support military action in syria failed earlier this week responded to obamas speech in a twitter post saturday i understand and support barack obamas position on syria cameron said an influential lawmaker in russia which has stood by syria and criticized the united states had his own theory the main reason obama is turning to the congress the military operation did not get enough support either in the world among allies of the us or in the united states itself alexei pushkov chairman of the internationalaffairs committee of the russian state duma said in a twitter post in the united states scattered groups of antiwar protesters around the country took to the streets saturday like many other americanswere just tired of the united states getting involved and invading and bombing other countries said robin rosecrans who was among hundreds at a los angeles demonstration what do syrias neighbors think why russia china iran stand by assad syrias government unfazed after obamas speech a military and political analyst on syrian state tv said obama is embarrassed that russia opposes military action against syria is crying for help for someone to come to his rescue and is facing two defeats on the political and military levels syrias prime minister appeared unfazed by the saberrattling the syrian armys status is on maximum readiness and fingers are on the trigger to confront all challenges wael nader alhalqi said during a meeting with a delegation of syrian expatriates from italy according to a banner on syria state tv that was broadcast prior to obamas address an anchor on syrian state television said obama appeared to be preparing for an aggression on syria based on repeated lies a top syrian diplomat told the state television network that obama was facing pressure to take military action from israel turkey some arabs and rightwing extremists in the united states i think he has done well by doing what cameron did in terms of taking the issue to parliament said bashar jaafari syrias ambassador to the united nations both obama and cameron he said climbed to the top of the tree and dont know how to get down the syrian government has denied that it used chemical weapons in the august attack saying that jihadists fighting with the rebels used them in an effort to turn global sentiments against it british intelligence had put the number of people killed in the attack at more than on saturday obama said all told well over people were murdered us secretary of state john kerry on friday cited a death toll of more than of them children no explanation was offered for the discrepancy iran us military action in syria would spark disaster opinion why strikes in syria are a bad idea\n",

            "the general services administration already under investigation for lavish spending allowed an employee to telecommute from hawaii even though he is based at the gsas kansas city missouri office a cnn investigation has found it cost more than for the business development specialist to travel to and from the mainland united states over the past year he is among several hundred gsa virtual workers who also travel to various conferences and their home offices costing the agency millions of dollars over the past three years under the program employees work from home and may live in another state from the region in which theyre actually assigned the kansas city employee who started his job in january is paid and works from his home in honolulu a gsa representative confirmed in the past year according to gsa travel records the employee has flown back to the mainland nine times for conferences and meetings four of those trips were to st louis four were to washington with a side trip to cincinnati and one was to san diego the total cost to taxpayers was jason klumb the gsas regional administrator for kansas city defended the hire the cost of that travel was included in the consideration of his candidacy as an employee as compared with the other applicants klumb said and when factoring all of those in it was determined that he was the best candidate even in light of the cost that would be incurred klumb called the gsas teleworking program a successful program thats going to lead to cost savings for taxpayers but a gsa spokeswoman said we are not going to defend this type of travel and a gsa employee in kansas city who requested anonymity said that hiring someone in hawaii to work for the kansas city region was ludicrous it doesnt make sense the employee said when you consider everything you need when you hire someone it would have been better to look for someone in the kansas city area it would have reduced the cost of travel by at least percent when you look at just the airfare of what it takes to from honolulu to washington dc where a lot of business is done dan tangherlini who was appointed acting gsa administrator this year said the agency was examining the cost of the entire teleworking program i think the most important part for the gsa to think about is make sure we open ourselves up avail ourselves to all the smart people in the country but then also make sure we have a clear business case he said if we have someone who is working in nebraska but reporting to boston there has to be a clear explanation for what value theyre providing and youve got to give me the business case youve got to explain to me why thats a costeffective move for the american people and thats a new standard that were asking everyone at gsa to adhere to the gsa virtual employee program is different from telework programs offered by many private companies including cnns parent company turner broadcasting in which some employees are encouraged to work from home some days of the week partially to reduce traffic congestion the house committee on oversight and government reform requested details about the gsas teleworking program in june that followed disclosures that virtual employees including in supervisory positions spent nearly in travel costs between october and june the american people have a right to know that federal bureaucrats who enjoy the benefits of virtual work are eligible and responsible stewards of the taxpayer dollars that support the program according to a letter from committee chairman rep darrell issa rcalifornia to the gsa the details requested by issa about the gsa program have not been provided to the committee cnn also requested the information more than two months ago through the federal freedom of information act but has been repeatedly told by the gsa that foia staff members have not finished compiling the material the general services administration which has more than employees and a billion budget is a relatively obscure federal agency that handles government real estate and other nonmilitary procurement congress launched an investigation into the gsa after a scathing inspector generals report issued this year showed lavish spending at the agencys western regions conference in las vegas in october the controversy became politically toxic after reports and video clips of the lavish conference were released the revelation prompted taxpayer indignation embarrassed the administration and put a spotlight on wasteful spending by the gsa jeff neely the gsa official who organized the conference resigned as did the agencys administrator martha johnson two of johnsons deputies were fired and eight other employees left the agency tangherlini a former treasury department official took over as acting gsa administrator in addition to the las vegas conference the gsa apparently spent to relocate an employee from denver to hawaii and probably millions more on other employees over a twoyear period according to a transcript of an interview with a gsa event planner and gsa employees most of them supervisors or other senior staff all subjects of inspector general investigations are still collecting their bonuses totaling more than million in taxpayer money in july a cnn investigation revealed that the gsas kansas city office spent more than to send employees to cooking classes to build team spirit while the classes do not amount to a significant sum of money in the world of trilliondollar government budgets insiders said it was part of the freespending culture that went on for years at the gsas kansas city regional headquarters gsa spokeswoman betsaida alcantara said in a statement this year that all the agencys practices are under a topdown review cnns sara anwar

hundred gsa virtual workers who also travel to various conferences and their home offices costing the agency millions of dollars over the past three years', 'under the program employees work from home and may live in another state from the region in which theyre actually assigned', 'the kansas city employee who started his job in january is paid and works from his home in honolulu a gsa representative confirmed', 'in the past year according to gsa travel records the employee has flown back to the mainland nine times for conferences and meetings four of those trips were to st louis four were to washington with a side trip to cincinnati and one was to san diego the total cost to taxpayers was', 'jason klumb the gsas regional administrator for kansas city defended the hire', 'the cost of that travel was included in the consideration of his candidacy as an employee as compared with the other applicants klumb said and when factoring all of those in it was determined that he was the best candidate even in light of the cost that would be incurred', 'klumb called the gsas teleworking program a successful program thats going to lead to cost savings for taxpayers', 'but a gsa spokeswoman said we are not going to defend this type of travel', 'and a gsa employee in kansas city who requested anonymity said that hiring someone in hawaii to work for the kansas city region was ludicrous', 'it doesnt make sense the employee said when you consider everything you need when you hire someone it would have been better to look for someone in the kansas city area it would have reduced the cost of travel by at least percent when you look at just the airfare of what it takes to from honolulu to washington dc where a lot of business is done', 'dan tangherlini who was appointed acting gsa administrator this year said the agency was examining the cost of the entire teleworking program', 'i think the most important part for the gsa to think about is make sure we open ourselves up avail ourselves to all the smart people in the country but then also make sure we have a clear business case he said if we have someone who is working in nebraska but reporting to boston there has to be a clear explanation for what value theyre providing and youve got to give me the business case youve got to explain to me why thats a costeffective move for the american people and thats a new standard that were asking everyone at gsa to adhere to', 'the gsa virtual employee program is different from telework programs offered by many private companies including cnns parent company turner broadcasting in which some employees are encouraged to work from home some days of the week partially to reduce traffic congestion', 'the house committee on oversight and government reform requested details about the gsas teleworking program in june that followed disclosures that virtual employees including in supervisory positions spent nearly in travel costs between october and june', 'the american people have a right to know that federal bureaucrats who enjoy the benefits of virtual work are eligible and responsible stewards of the taxpayer dollars that support the program according to a letter from committee chairman rep darrell issa rcalifornia to the gsa', 'the details requested by issa about the gsa program have not been provided to the committee cnn also requested the
